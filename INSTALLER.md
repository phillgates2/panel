# Installer Guide

The Panel installer is now GUI-only. Use:

- `python -m tools.installer.gui`

Features:
- Preflight checks, config validation, guided wizard
- Role-based presets (dev/staging/prod)
- State-based rollback and crash recovery
- Advanced logging and diagnostics

For automation and headless environments, use Docker Compose or manual setup.
